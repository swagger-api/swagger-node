# <a name="whatis">What is the swagger module?

The swagger module provides tools for designing and building APIs entirely in Node.js. It integrates with popular Node.js servers, including Express, hapi, restify, and Sails, as well as any Connect-based middleware. 

With swagger, you can specify, build, and test your API from the very beginning, and it allows you to make changes to your design without rewriting the logic of your implementation. It explicitly isolates the design of your interfaces from writing your controller code, leading to a much better software development lifecycle.

Swagger module provides a CLI  for project scaffolding and lifecycle management (create, edit, start, test) and bundles libraries for a design first API development workflow. 

# <a name="installation">Installing the swagger module

See the [Installing swagger](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-node/blob/master/docs/install.md) for details. 

# <a name="using">Using the swagger module

Go to the [swagger module doc page](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-node/blob/master/docs/README.md). It includes all the information you need to get started. 

# About this project

This initiative grew out of Apigee-127, an API design-first development framework using Swagger. 
Apigee donated the code to create the swagger-node project in 2015.

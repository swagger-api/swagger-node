[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-node)

The `swagger` module provides tools for designing and building APIs entirely in Node.js. It integrates with popular Node.js servers, including Express, hapi, restify, and Sails, as well as any Connect-based middleware. With `swagger`, you can specify, build, and test your API from the very beginning, on your laptop. It allows you to change and iterate your design without rewriting the logic of your implementation.

## Install swagger

Install using npm. For complete instructions, see the [install](./docs/install.md) page.

## Develop your API in the Swagger Editor

Interactive, browser-based, [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) provides Swagger 2.0 validation and endpoint routing, generates docs on the fly, and uses easy-to-read YAML.

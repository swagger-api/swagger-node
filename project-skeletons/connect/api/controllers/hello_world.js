 Modules make it possible to import JavaScript files into your application.  Modules are imported
 using 'require' statements that give you a reference to the module.

/*
 Once you 'require' a module you can reference the things that it exports.  These are defined in module.exports.

 For a controller in a127 (which this is) you should export the functions referenced in your Swagger document by name.

 Either:
  - The HTTP Verb of the corresponding operation (get, put, post, delete, etc)
  - Or the operationId associated with the operation in your Swagger document

  In the starter/skeleton project the 'get' operation on the '/hello' path has an operationId named 'hello'.  Here,
  we specify that in the exports of this module that 'hello' maps to the function named 'hello'

  Functions in a127 controllers used for operations should take two parameters:

  Param 1: a handle to the request object
  Param 2: a handle to the response object
